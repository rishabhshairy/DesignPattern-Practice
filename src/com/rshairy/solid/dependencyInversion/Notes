Dependency Inversion Principle

Classes should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes

Example not following this principle

class MacBook {
 private final WiredKeyBoard keyb;
 private final WiredMouse mouse;

 public MacBook() {
    keyb = new WiredKeyBoard;
    mouse = new WiredMouse;
 }
}

Here in above example, we have tightly coupled MacBook with wired keyboard and wired mouse
we will not be able to enhance it
